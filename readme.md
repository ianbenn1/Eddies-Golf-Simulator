This is a fun, colourful top down golfing game with various levels and characters made as a final project for CIS*4030 - Mobile Development at the University of Guelph during Winter 2020.

The development of the app was hampered and eventually cut short by the COVID-19 pandemic, but it is playable in it's current configuration. References to 'Eddie's Golf Simulator 2 Pro' indicate features that were not/are yet to be developed, due to time constraints in the project.

The app was inspired by the original Eddie's Golf Simulator, created by a group member in CIS*4030 during highschool. Unfortunately this group member left after schools were closed, and I developed the app myself.

Eddie's Golf Simulator 2 is developed in React Native, making it cross platfrom compatable. It utilizes Expo for easy packaging, testing and running. Eddies Golf Simulator makes use of the React Native Game Engine, and MatterJS for physics and game rendering.
